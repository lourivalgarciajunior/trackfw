```bash
trackfw init [--brownfield] [--ai-tools codex,...]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--brownfield` | Activates lenient mode for 30 days (violations become warnings) |

- `trackfw.yaml` — project configuration
- `scripts/trackfw-validate.sh` — validation script for CI
- `CLAUDE.md` — context for Claude Code (if selected)
- `.claude/commands/` — 7 slash commands for Claude Code
- `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/`, `.codex/agents/`, and `.codex/hooks.json` — Codex integration (if selected)

## `trackfw adr new`

Creates a new Architecture Decision Record via interactive wizard.

```bash
trackfw adr new
```

### Expected output

```
created docs/adr/ADR-2026-06-13-decision-title.md
```

---

## `trackfw adr list`

## `trackfw req new`

Creates a new requirement via interactive wizard with contextual probes.

REQ-2026-06-10-export-report.md      Closed
```

|------|-------------|

# Interactive wizard
trackfw roadmap new

# With title and REQ defined
trackfw roadmap new --title "Implement OAuth" --req docs/req/REQ-2026-06-13-oauth-login.md

# Shorthand
trackfw roadmap new --from-req docs/req/REQ-2026-06-13-oauth-login.md
