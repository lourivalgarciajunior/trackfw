description: Inspect or maintain ADR, REQ, ROADMAP, traceability, lifecycle state, and trackfw validation. Use for governance questions and artifact changes.

name: trackfw-plan
description: Plan a trackfw-governed implementation before code changes. Use for ADRs, REQs, roadmaps, microbatches, acceptance criteria, and validation commands.

Inspect existing artifacts and code. Create required decisions and requirements before a decision-complete roadmap. Keep the roadmap in analyzing until coding starts.

name: trackfw-implement
description: Implement work governed by an existing trackfw roadmap. Use for features and fixes that must follow lifecycle and validation gates.

Identify the matching REQ and roadmap, move it to wip, implement one microbatch at a time, run project tests and \`trackfw validate --json\`, then update lifecycle state.

name: trackfw-review
description: Review a change for governance traceability, correctness, security, regressions, missing tests, and roadmap acceptance.

Stay read-only unless fixes are requested. Report evidence-backed findings by severity and verify the linked REQ, roadmap, acceptance criteria, tests, and validation output.

name: trackfw-release
description: Prepare and verify a trackfw release. Use for versioning, changelog, packaging, parity, and publication gates.
