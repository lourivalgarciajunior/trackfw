name: trackfw-governance
description: Inspect or maintain ADR, REQ, ROADMAP, traceability, lifecycle state, and trackfw validation. Use for governance questions and artifact changes.

Run \`trackfw context --format=json\`, preserve the ADR → REQ → ROADMAP chain, and finish with \`trackfw validate --json\`.
`,

name: trackfw-plan
description: Plan a trackfw-governed implementation before code changes. Use for ADRs, REQs, roadmaps, microbatches, acceptance criteria, and validation commands.
---
Inspect existing artifacts and code. Create required decisions and requirements before a decision-complete roadmap. Keep the roadmap in analyzing until coding starts.

name: trackfw-implement
description: Implement work governed by an existing trackfw roadmap. Use for features and fixes that must follow lifecycle and validation gates.
---
Identify the matching REQ and roadmap, move it to wip, implement one microbatch at a time, run project tests and \`trackfw validate --json\`, then update lifecycle state.
`,
  'trackfw-review': `---
name: trackfw-review
description: Review a change for governance traceability, correctness, security, regressions, missing tests, and roadmap acceptance.
---
Stay read-only unless fixes are requested. Report evidence-backed findings by severity and verify the linked REQ, roadmap, acceptance criteria, tests, and validation output.
`,

name: trackfw-release
description: Prepare and verify a trackfw release. Use for versioning, changelog, packaging, parity, and publication gates.
---
Run all quality and parity gates, derive SemVer from commits, and stop before tags or publication unless explicitly authorized.
