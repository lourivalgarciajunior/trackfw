# check-manifest-version-gate.sh — gate for AC3 + full #338 resolution.
#
# Asserts four things in sequence:
#   1. gen-platform-manifests.sh runs without error (generation happened).
#   2. Every generated @trackfw-bin/<platform>/package.json carries the version from
#      internal/version/version.go — not a hand-written number.
#   3. That version matches the latest versioned section in CHANGELOG.md — the cross-check
#      that issue #338 identified as missing from the pre-release pipeline.
#   4. npm/package.json and pypi/pyproject.toml agree with internal/version/version.go.
#
# WHY SOME FILES ARE GENERATED AND OTHERS ARE MONITORED:
#   - The 6 @trackfw-bin/<platform>/package.json manifests are generated (not committed)
#     because their sole purpose is to declare the binary path per platform; they carry
#     no other information. Generating them from the Go source eliminates drift by
#     construction and costs nothing at runtime.
#   - npm/package.json and pypi/pyproject.toml MUST remain hand-written in the tree:
#     `npm ci` reads npm/package.json directly and cannot work from a generated file;
#     package metadata (description, keywords, scripts, devDependencies) lives alongside
#     the version field and is meaningfully maintained by humans. Generating these files
#     would break `npm ci` and obscure intentional metadata edits. The right answer for
#     these two is continuous monitoring, not generation.
#
# Vacuity guard: zero manifests found after generation → reprova.
# This gate never passes silently: every verification emits ok/FAIL, and a non-zero FAIL
# count forces exit 1.
#
# Reconciliation (inviolável — CLAUDE.md regra dura):
#   - Assertion 1 proves: gen-platform-manifests.sh ran and produced output.
#   - Assertion 2 proves: generated manifests carry the same version as Go's single source.
#   - Assertion 3 proves: the Go version and CHANGELOG top section agree — the #338 check
#     now fires at gate time, not only at 'trackfw release tag' runtime.
#   - Assertion 4 proves: npm/package.json and pypi/pyproject.toml agree with version.go —
#     the two hand-written version sites that remain after Wave 3 are now continuously
#     monitored, closing issue #338 fully.

# ── Step 5: Conditional check for pypi/trackfw/__init__.py literals ──────────
# WHY CONDITIONAL:
#   This file carries two hardcoded version literals (the importlib.metadata
#   fallback and the bare except fallback). Wave 3 (ML-3A) of the v8 roadmap
#   deletes the entire pypi/trackfw/ directory. Between now and Wave 3 execution
#   those literals are not covered by any other gate, creating a window where a
#   version bump could leave them stale. A plain check would fail when Wave 3
#   runs; a missing check leaves a silent window.
#
#   The conditional pattern resolves both without future maintenance:
#   - File present: verify both literals against internal/version/version.go.
#   - File absent: print an informational line (not silent) and continue.
#   The informational else-branch is mandatory — a missing else is
#   indistinguishable from a check that never ran, which is the failure mode
#   this project has seen in four other gates.
#
#   Other gates should use this same pattern for any file that Wave 3 removes:
#   guard with [ -f ], emit a named informational message in the else branch,
#   and document which wave makes the file absent.
#
# Reconciliation:
#   - Arm 1 (file present, literal matches): both hardcoded literals agree with version.go.
#   - Arm 2 (file present, literal diverges): a version bump did not update __init__.py.
#   - Arm 3 (file absent): Wave 3 has run; this check is inapplicable; gate continues.
